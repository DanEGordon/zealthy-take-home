You can route to the admin page tby going to pages/admin

Thank you for looking in! I first want to get the elephant out of the way and say that the full version of my product is not properly deploying to vercel. Vercel seems to have some sort of problem with the api calls I built. They work fine on my local run, annd when I build it and run the code locally it works there too. I have a feeling there's some small change I need to make to fix the calls, But I'm close to the deadline as is so I figured the best thing to do was to just show you the work I've done. With this in mind, the data page is inaccessible, data is not persisted on refreshing the page, and finializing a user profile won't do anything.

The version that is deployed shows a very solid implementation of the frontend requirements. The admin page works great, all information is properly peserved in context, and the flow moves well. I would've liked to do more work around disabling next buttons until each page is filled out, but all in all I'm happy with what I got accomplished in the time alloted. I hope it portrays the image of someone with strong frontend design principles, clean coding patterns, and a strong handle on typescript, though they still have more to learn and are willing to admit it. Thank you for your consideration!
